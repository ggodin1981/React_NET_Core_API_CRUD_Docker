# React_NET_Core_API_CRUD_Docker
I will create a sample inventory product application backend using the .NET Core Web API, along with a frontend built with React.js. Additionally, I will containerize the application using Docker

In Summary
"I created a product inventory management backend application using .NET Core and SQL Server, implementing various API endpoints for performing CRUD operations. Later, I developed the frontend application using React.js and integrated it with the backend using Axios. Additionally, I containerized both applications using Docker."
